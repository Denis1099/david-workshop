- **Intermediate skill level** - performs Olympic lifts regularly but with technical issues
- **Frustration points:** Feels stuck, inconsistent technique, conflicting advice from different coaches
- **Learning background:** Group classes, general coaches, YouTube videos - no focused individual instruction

**Pain Points:**
- "Every training session just reinforces the mistake"
- "I have potential but can't execute it properly"
- "I don't understand what's wrong, and explanations don't really help"
- "Everyone says something different"
- "I'm afraid I'll get injured with heavier weights"

**What they're really looking for:**
- Personal diagnosis of their specific technical issues
- Simple, clear methodology to understand the movement
- Control over technique instead of gambling with each lift
- Confidence in training without fear
- The "one tip" that will change everything
