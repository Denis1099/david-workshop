**Subject**: React App Static Files Not Serving - Need Configuration Help

**Message:**
```
Hi CloudBe Support,

I need help configuring my React app deployment on liftvinov.com. The static files are not being served correctly.

ISSUE:
- Getting 404 errors for /static/css/ and /static/js/ files
- React app won't load due to missing CSS/JS files

CURRENT SETUP:
- Domain: liftvinov.com
- Uploaded entire build/ folder contents
- Document root set to build folder
- Index file: index.html

REQUIRED CONFIGURATION:
1. Enable static file serving for /static/ subdirectory
2. Configure SPA fallback to index.html for React routing
3. Enable MIME types for .css, .js, .webp, .svg files

FILE STRUCTURE:
build/
├── index.html (loads correctly)
├── static/
│   ├── css/main.675c21e3.css (404 error)
│   └── js/main.9fa22e01.js (404 error)
├── images/ (works)
└── other files

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
- https://liftvinov.com/static/css/main.675c21e3.css should serve CSS file
- https://liftvinov.com/static/js/main.9fa22e01.js should serve JS file
- All /static/ files should be accessible

Please configure the server to serve static files from the /static/ directory.

Thank you!
```

### Solution 2: Check Your Upload

**Verify these files exist in CloudBe:**
- `index.html` ✅
- `static/css/main.675c21e3.css` ❓
- `static/js/main.9fa22e01.js` ❓
- `images/` folder ✅

**Re-upload if needed:**
1. Delete current files
2. Upload entire build/ folder contents
3. Ensure static/ folder is included

### Solution 3: CloudBe Settings Check

**In CloudBe Dashboard:**
1. **Document Root**: Should be your uploaded folder
2. **Static Files**: Enable static file serving
3. **Directory Access**: Allow subdirectory access
4. **Index File**: index.html
5. **Error Pages**: Set 404 to index.html (for React routing)

### Solution 4: Alternative Hosting

**If CloudBe can't fix it, try:**
- **Netlify**: Excellent React support
- **Vercel**: Built for React apps
- **Firebase Hosting**: Good static hosting
- **GitHub Pages**: Free alternative

## 🧪 Test Commands

**Test static file access directly:**
```bash
# These should work:
curl -I https://liftvinov.com/static/css/main.675c21e3.css
curl -I https://liftvinov.com/static/js/main.9fa22e01.js

# Should return 200 OK, not 404
```

## 📞 CloudBe Support Info

**What to tell them:**
- "Need React app static file serving configuration"
- "Static files in /static/ folder returning 404"
- "Need subdirectory access enabled"
- "This is a standard React build structure"

**Common hosting terms to use:**
- SPA (Single Page Application)
- Static file serving
- Subdirectory access
- MIME type configuration
- React app deployment

## 🚀 Expected Resolution

After CloudBe fixes configuration:
1. CSS will load (styling appears)
2. JS will load (React app works)
3. Images will load properly
4. Navigation will work
5. No more 404 errors

The issue is 100% on CloudBe's side - they need to configure their server to serve files from the /static/ subdirectory.
